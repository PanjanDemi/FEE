# File Extension Exchanger

Hi! You've found my github :3

This executable converts all files of one type to another type by renaming the file and changing the extension. Obviously warning for user error, don't do this to things that you're not comfortable losing. I literally just made this to convert *mov* files to *mp4*.



A Sample FEE Window:

1. Input the initial file extension here, without the period
2. Input the output file extension here, without the period
3. Input the directory containing the files to be converted
4. Alternatively, click this button to be taken to a folder select window.
5. Finally, click this button to convert your files! Another dialogue box will pop up and tell you how many files got changed
