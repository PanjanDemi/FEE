# File Type Converter

Hi! You've found my github :3

This script is run from the command line and converts all files of one type to another type by renaming the file and changing the extension. Obviously warning for user error, don't do this to things that you're not comfortable losing them. I literally just made this to convert *mov* files to *mp4*.

The script has 3 command line arguments:
- Initial File Type
- Output File Type
- Absolute Directory
Side note: While neither file type arguments use the period, it wouldn't be difficult to modify the script to have it accept them. 

```py main.py [Initial File Type] [Output File Type] [Directory]```

```py main.py mov mp4 C:\users\[user]\downloads```
